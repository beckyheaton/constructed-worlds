                The internet can be a beautiful place I promise. 
                Any world you can imagine we can make it in HTML and maybe some CSS and JavaScript. 
                The video above is of a world called Perisher Valley where I skied with my good friend 
                Nubia who has since moved to London. I miss her very much. I didn't think i would be 
                able to go skiing because i didn't have any money but Nubia said we could camp. 
                It was so cold that on the last day I developed tonsillitis and was sick for two weeks. 
                Love you Nubia, call me ðŸ¤™ x
